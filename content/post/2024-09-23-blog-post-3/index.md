This Week's Objective: Compare and contrast Silver (2024) and Morris (2024). Based on my opinion, which of the two is the better approach? 

Nate Silver makes some updates to the 2024 presidential election forecast model. One of the biggest changes to the model from the 2020 presidential election is the removal of COVID-19 effects and its impact on other variables in the model such as the convention bounce–boost in the polls for presidential candidates after the convention. In 2020, the conventions were held virtually and likely drew less excitement for the candidates. 

Another change made to the model is a result of Democrats' recent turnout in special elections. The previous model predicted that a lower turnout would benefit the Republican candidates but according to an article by the New York Times (cited by Silver) Democrats appear to be turning out in high rates and thus no longer counts low turnout as an advantage for Republicans and may even be a benefit for the Democratic candidates. 

Silver takes into account strong third party candidates and concludes that RFK Jr. pulls voters evenly from both Trump and Biden.

Silver is wary of presidential forecasts that are based on fundamentals but recognizes the value in incorporating fundamentals into the 2024 forecast model such as jobs, spending, income, manufacturing, inflation, and the stock market. 

Morris shares the new 538 presidential election forecast model built from scratch. The most notable differences are the convention effect, more economic indicators, and state correlation. 

Whereas Silver gives a weight to the convention bounce and attaches a value to that bounce, Morris allows for more variable effects. Instead of attaching a value to the convention bounce, it is a penalty that can be adjusted which I view as a plus because the effect of the convention for both parties may have different effects on the candidate’s support in the polls depending on the programming of the convention. 

Additionally, Morris includes almost twice as many economic indicators in the model. One of the indicators that I found to be a particular point of strength is the University of Michigan's index of consumer sentiment because although the economy and more specifically GDP is always increasing the fact is that inflation and wage increases do not always correlate. The average American voter may not feel as great about the economy as other fundamental economic indicators may suggest. 

The quality of a forecast for state-level predictions is as good as the quality of the polls. However, state polls are not conducted at similar frequencies, leaving some states without enough data to make strong predictions. To combat this, Morris’ model allows states with similar demographics, location, and other characteristics that predict a voter’s support for either candidate to let polls from similar states influence the state-level predictions for similar states. 

Despite the differences in the models, both forecast models leverage polling averages and fundamentals to predict the outcome. Both models weigh the polls differently based on sample size, date, and the quality of the pollster. 

Which model is better? I understand why Morris made the changes he did for the forecast model and the reasoning behind these changes seems sound but Silver’s model has been around and refined for longer. Morris’ model is completely new. One thing that Morris’ model did not address thoroughly is the effect of third party candidates on the forecast. It may not mean much for this election because RFK Jr. has pulled out of the race and because the electorate is becoming more calcified.
