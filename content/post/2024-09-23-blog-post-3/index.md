This Week's Objective: Compare and contrast Silver (2024) and Morris (2024). Based on my opinion, which of the two is the better approach? 

Before I begin I will provide a summary of Silver (2024) and Morris (2024) 


Nate Silver makes some updates to the 2024 presidential election forecast model. One of the biggest changes to the model from the 2020 presidential election is the removal of COVID-19 effects and its impact on other variables in the model such as the convention bounceâ€“boost in the polls for presidential candidates after the convention. In 2020, the conventions were held virtually and likely drew less excitement for the candidates. 

Another change made to the model is a result of Democrats' recent turnout in special elections. The previous model predicted that a lower turnout would benefit the Republican candidates but according to an article by the New York Times (cited by Silver) Democrats appear to be turning out in high rates and thus no longer counts low turnout as an advantage for Republicans and may even be a benefit for the Democratic candidates. 

Silver takes into account strong third party candidates and concludes that RFK Jr. pulls voters evenly from both Trump and Biden.

Silver is wary of presidential forecasts that are based on fundamentals but recognizes the value in incorporating fundamentals into the 2024 forecast model such as jobs, spending, income, manufacturing, inflation, and the stock market.
